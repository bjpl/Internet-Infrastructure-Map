## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

## Examples in Practice

### ✅ Good Examples

**Giving Feedback:**
```
"I noticed the API call could be more efficient. Have you considered
batching the requests? Here's an example: [code]. What do you think?"
```

**Disagreeing Constructively:**
```
"I see your point about caching, but I'm concerned about memory usage.
Could we explore a hybrid approach that limits cache size?"
```

**Asking for Help:**
```
"I'm new to Three.js and struggling with the globe rendering.
Could someone point me to relevant documentation or examples?"
```

**Recognizing Contributions:**
```
"Great work on the data quality dashboard! The visual indicators
really help users understand data confidence."
```

### ❌ Bad Examples

**Harsh Criticism:**
```
"This code is terrible. Did you even test this before committing?"
```

**Personal Attacks:**
```
"Clearly you don't understand basic programming concepts."
```

**Gatekeeping:**
```
"If you don't know TypeScript, you shouldn't be contributing."
```

**Dismissive Behavior:**
```
"That's a dumb question. Just Google it."
```
